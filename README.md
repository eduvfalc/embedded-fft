# FFT for Embedded Systems
An implementation of the FFT Cooley-Tukey algorithm using the [Compositional Numeric Library](https://github.com/johnmcfarlane/cnl)'s fixed-point representation and the [Embedded Template Library](https://github.com/ETLCPP/etl)'s `vector`.

# Pre-requisites
Install the Compositional Numeric Library's and Embedded Template Library's header files locally in your system (follow the steps explained in their repos).

# Building

For your convenience, you can build the application using the script `build.sh`. You will need cmake for that.

# Testing

You can run the tests by executing the script `test.sh`. You will need googletest for that.
